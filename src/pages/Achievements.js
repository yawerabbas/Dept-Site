        <h1>Structural Engineering</h1>
        <p>Department of Civil and Infrastructural Engineering, IIT Jodhpur plans to establish a state-of-the-art Laboratory in the Structural Engineering domain. Further, it also plans to establish various theme based laboratories such as Structural Health Monitoring Laboratory, Structural Modelling and Simulation Laboratory, Risk, Reliability and Stochastic Modelling Laboratory, Wind Energy and Engineering Laboratory, Steel and Composite Structures Laboratory, and Earthquake Engineering Laboratory. It involves studying ambient vibrations, conducting experimental studies on models/prototypes of structural elements and assemblies under various static and dynamic loading conditions, and providing technical services for testing and researching the structural behavior and properties of materials.

          These laboratories envision to boost the research and teaching ecosystem in the structure engineering and interdisciplinary domains. At present, the Structural Engineer Laboratory caters experiments related to non-destructive testing such as rebound hammer, ultrasonic pulse velocity, rebar locator, half-cell potentiometer, Maxwell reciprocal theorem apparatus, two and three hinged arch apparatus, suspension bridge apparatus, pin jointed truss apparatus, elastic properties of deflected beam apparatus, behaviour of columns and struts apparatus, elastically coupled beam apparatus and unsymmetrical bending apparatus. At present, the laboratory is equipped with two servo-controlled hydraulic testing machines, a 1000 kN universal testing machine (UTM), and a 3000 kN compression testing machine (CTM). Additionally, the laboratory has an 8-channel universal amplifier HBK make, a 100 kN Flexure Testing Machine (FTM), and various other equipment suitable for undergraduate level laboratory work. The laboratory also has multiple software platforms for numerical modelling and simulation such as ABAQUS, STAAD Pro and SAP.
