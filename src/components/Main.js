                            The rapidly urbanizing society and increasing quality of life demand reliable and
                            intelligent infrastructure systems which are capable of catering to the societal
                            needs at different scales â€“ from an individual to the community level. Consequently,
                            the civil and infrastructure industry has undergone profound changes and is constantly
                            evolving. However, the new-age designs and innovations in the civil and infrastructure
                            industry can only be driven by a group of engineering graduates having multidisciplinary
                            training and a sound understanding of emerging technologies. The Department of Civil and
                            Infrastructure Engineering, IIT Jodhpur  esatablished in January 2020. We started academics
                            programs in the academic year 2020-2021. The department offers unique programs that incorporate
                            and integrate the elements of conventional civil engineering with advanced transformative technologies such as
                            artificial intelligence (AI), cyber-physical-systems (CPS), digital twins (DT), and automated management and
                            information systems
